# ArcTap
A Freelancer Guild of Talented Craftsmen.

## Membership
* __Now:__ For the first 6 months we are going to take it easy and see where it goes. There has been talks of annual dues and equity, all talk at his point.
* __Future:__ We want to grow slowly, but yet have enough talent on hand where everyone can works the hours they want. After the first client I think we will have a clearer picture. We should really focus on now, to make it all happen.
* __Dues:__ To keep the company moving forward, we are thinking of taking a small percent of each project. Right now we are thinking 10% to help pay for lawyer, accountant, hosting, etc.
* __Income:__ We plan on charing weekly rates of $10,000. Simple math $10,000 / 40 Hours = $250 an hour.
* __Benefits:__ Right now it is not much. Access to an incredible group, collecting money from the client, higher income, working remote. In the future we plan on incorporating to provide proper legal coverage and contacts.

## Incoming Request
* Each client has a Project Manger. The PM will be the first and main contact with the client. They will be there for the intro meeting to get a better grasp of the requirements of the project and what is needed for it. Once they know the scope they will seek out the appropriate team members to take on that project. The PM will see the project until the end.
* We still have yet to decide on how jobs will be distributed.

## TODO
* Gather all team member's email
* Add members to the repo
* Add members to team@arctap.com
* Create a process for how to handle incoming request
* Maybe create a wiki of everyone. Each members page could include personal strengths (e.g. Rails, iOS, JavaScript).
* Thinking about building a tool for the client to see invoices and were we are on projects.
* Build some kind of calendar to keep track of who is available for each week of the year.
