                        <p><strong>ArcTap is a team of amazing freelancers that regularly work together on mobile, tablet, &amp; web based projects.</strong></p>
                        <p class="last">The idea of putting together a great team was easy, the hard part now is to find time for all the awesome ideas out there. Because of this we are very selective on what projects we take on. What makes us unique is not only the solid team, but what the team is made up of. We understand that apps sometimes need more then just a designer and a developer.</p>

                        <p>We are all lucky to have such an amazing network of trusted and experienced talent. We have been around the block a few times and understand that it is cheaper in the long run to build it right the first time.</p>

                        <p>Classic is what we build. We have found that chasing the trends puts a quick expiration date on your product. With minimal maintenance, to keep up with best practices, you will have a lasting image.</p>
